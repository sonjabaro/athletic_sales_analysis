Week 5 Challenge
This week's challenge furthered our skills on cleaning and analyzing data.  
I used the concat function to join the data, some of our past challenge skills to clean it up,(search for nulls etc).
I revisited our activities to answer questions I had and watched our class zoom recordings and had a TA session to answer questions I had.
